        <p className='Aboutsection1_div_p1'>The aim of our site, which was established on 30.10.2024, is to offer quality TV series to our users. And with your support, we plan to make great progress on this path. And we hope that with your help and support, this site will grow greatly..</p>
        <p className='Aboutsection1_div_p2'>As the Filmopolis Team, our main mission is to always bring you films within the framework of "respect" by adopting "quality" as a principle. At this point, we would like to thank the fansubs whose translations we published. As a matter of fact, we are standing thanks to their efforts. While we express our gratitude to the fansubs, let us also point out that we have our own translation team and we publish them.</p>
        <p className='Aboutsection1_div_p3'>With our translation team, we have brought many quality films to you and we continue to do so. While we were initially translating only "untranslated or unfinished" films, we are now also translating current or favorite films into Turkish.  Moreover, we upload these series in a quality that you will never find on the internet. You can also contribute to our site with your valuable comments and share your opinions and thoughts with our visitors.</p>
